# Maintaining a clean repository

Follow [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) rules to help build this club!

# Safe Content

To make sure no files are lost and avoid confusion, follow the following rules:

1. When editing, making or deleting files, you must create a separate
branch or commit to a branch, never commit to master branch.
2. If you do create a new branch, name it with whatever you have edited the
most. Ex: `guidelines`
3. When committing to a branch, name it first with whatever you have edited the
most followed by a brief summary. Ex: `guidelines: Added some guidelines`
4. Once done, do a pull request, which will be named with the commit name,
and assign another other leader to approve the request. In need of an emergency
change, make sure you have everything correct by going to the "Files Changed"
tab in the pull request and accept the request yourself.

# First Meeting

Welcome to Programming Club!

## Setting Up

- Make sure you have one leader welcoming everyone to the club. Ex: ` Welcome
to Programming Club! Come on in! `

- Have the rest of the leaders talking to new hackers as they come in and create
 a friendly environment. Ex: `Hello There! I'm Samuel Escapa, one of the
 leaders of this club, what's your name? [Peter] Hi Peter, Welcome!`

## Presentation

Have a good start presentation after new hackers have settled, introduce all
leaders and advisor. Talk about __briefly__ what the club is about, and
split the talking time to all the leaders. Have a transition between each
person talking. Ex: `This is why programming is so important. Next Kevin
will talk about our curriculum for this year.`


//Here to down, you are talking to the hackers.

## Introductory Talk

- Why is programming awesome?
  - Programming brings unlimited opportunities to anybody in the
  world with the right technologies.
  - Make School Founder Jeremy Rossman had this great speech.
  - Your smartphone is more powerful than the computer we used to send a human
  to the moon.
  - Only 60 years ago, our technologies would have been considered magic. And
  in a world where magic exists, there are people who know how to use magic,
  and then there are muggles.
  - You want to be in category A.
  - Every year that goes by, there are more and more industries that can be
  transformed by computers. In fact, it's hard to think of an industry that
  won't be disrupted by technology.
  - If you were the king of the Roman Empire in 25, you would have ruled over
  56.8 million people. But by 2016, 2 billion consumers will have smartphones,
  which means you can impact 2 billion lives.

## Curriculum

- What are we learning this year.
  - We are going to learn how to make great websites and web applications!
  - Starting briefly with HTML/CSS (It's totally fine if you don't
   know what it is)
  - We will then proceed with Javascript and Node.js.
  - Microsoft, Paypal, Quizlet and surprisingly Walmart use Node.js.

## Week Cycles

- We are going to work in cycles of 4 weeks.
  - 1st week will be Workshops, where we will learn new skills and use previous
  ones.
  - 2nd and 3rd week will be project time, where you will work with a partner to
   create a project.
  - 4th week will be demo week, everyone will demo and ship their new project to
    the club.


## [Ice Breaker](#ice-breakers)

# Ice Breakers

### Rock Paper Scissors

```

Time: 5-15 min
Materials: none
Number: best for 10-30

```

Separate the hackers in groups of 3-7, depending on the amount of people there
are.

Everyone plays rock paper scissors against each other, 1 vs 1 best of 1s.
If you loose you leave the circle. Now in order to win, (Depending on the number
 of people) you need to be able to remember the names of the people you have
defeated.
